      <description>Gaussian DistributionsFundamental to understanding a Gaussian process is a Gaussian distribution.The 1 dimensional version of the Gaussian distribution is the Normal distribution or the Bell Curve.
The plot of a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 is shown below. Note that the curve doesnâ€™t look like a perfect bell as the data has been simulated
set.seed(0)plot(density(rnorm(100000)),main = bquote(&amp;quot;N(&amp;quot;~mu~&amp;quot;=0,&amp;quot;~sigma^2~&amp;quot;=1)&amp;quot;))A bi-variate Gaussian distribution is simply a Gaussian distribution in 2 dimensions.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis post will cover the following topics
Differences between Bayesian and Frequentist ApproachesA Simple Bayesian AnalysisSimple Bayesian Linear RegressionBayesianism vs FrequentismIn the simplest terms, in Frequentism parameters are fixed while data can vary.Whereas, in Bayesianism parameters can vary while data is fixed
For frequentists,probability only has meaning in terms of a limiting case of repeated measurements, it is fundamentally related to the frequencies of events.</description>
